<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QXGhjTc/1.png" alt="1" border="0" />

This is an Ecommerce platform where a user can register themselves to sell items on the platform and track the performance of their products to deliver products for better profits.

It includes a product listings page and a product page where a user who is interested can buy the products.

A user can see and manage what’s on their cart. It includes both the front end and the backend part so it’s a full stack application.

The payment procedures are handled with the Stripe API.

It also includes different product listing pages which can also be dynamically sorted according to the users choice.

The listings will get updated in real time. If a user wants to know more about a product then they can know more about the product such as the available sizes and the price of the product.

The cart icon and the cart page will update in real time according to the user. A user can also login and register before selling items on the Ecommerce Website.

In case of a data breach and for risk management all the passwords which are saved in the database are not saved as raw strings but rather as AES Encrypted strings. So that users can rest assured that their data is in safe hands.

The front end does not directly talk with the database but rather talks to the back end using an REST API.
